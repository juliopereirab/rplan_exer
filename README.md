RANPLAN EXERCISES

First of all many thanks for considering my application. 
In this folder you will find the files for the three different exercises: 

- quarto.cs and quarto.exe for the 1st exercise
- diagram.pdf for the second exercise
- singleNumber.cs and singleNumber.exe for the 3rd exercise. 

Although the 3rd exercise was just about cleaning the code, I decided to run it and make it as much functional as possible. 

All .exe files are ready to run on the console. 

I'll be attentive to follow up, 

Regards,
